Planned Features:
- Allow user to specify how many days they want to look back when requesting new songs
- Apply best practices for setting db_path
- Improve performance by storing artist/song data in local DB instead of pulling from API every time (use DBT?)



Ongoing:
- Show new songs from subscribed artists

Done:
- Exception handling when no artist is found
- Fix artist_confirm form when user does not confirm (https://forum.rasa.com/t/form-gets-stuck-on-yes-no-questions/31366)
